    <h2>Contact</h2>
    <p>
        There are a whole varitey of ways that you can contact me. Pick your 
        favourite. I am lucky enough to share my name with someone who does 
        similar work to myself so watch out for the variety of usernames that I 
        use.

        All of the cool engineers are on Twitter these days and I am no

        If you want to send me something a little longer then drop me a line on 
        my personal email address. I try to respond to all emails which are
        directly addressed to me.

    <p>
        Recruitment types seem to love LinkedIn. I tend to accept connection 
        requests from people who I have met in some professional capacity or 
        whose profiles interest me.
