These files are used to generate my highly professional home page, robin.pm. As you can see, it's pretty basic at the moment and definitely under construction... that will hopefully change soon when I have a bit more free time. 

If you spot any factual errors or spelling mistakes, please do feel free to raise an issue or PR and I will do my best to get it corrected. 

TODO: 
- Sort out the layout - the default template looks great but a little too generic and slightly lamee
- Flesh out the content 
- Make this readme into a proper markdown file (meta)...
