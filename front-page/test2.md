<h1>Who am I?</h1>
<p>
    I am a full stack developer at a well-known airline who has recently specialised in front-end. My current role is as one of the technical leads for the redevelopment of the multi-billion GBP selling flow from a legacy server-rendered technology to an AngularJS frontend with a RESTful backend. 
</p>

<p>
    In a previous life I worked on the legacy website, primarily in Java service development with a number of libraries including Apache Common Chains with Spring.

<p>
    At the risk of keyword stuffing, I have exposure to the following technologies and concepts as part of my work, education and hobbies: JavaScript, HTML5, AngularJS, Node.js, Express, gulp, grunt, Karma, jasmine, REST, Hateoas, Java, Java Spring, JSP, MySQL, Agile, *nix, JUnit, Cucumber, Selenium Webdriver, Smartling (i18n), TagMan (Tag Management), C#, SASS, svn/git, Log4j, Nexus, OOP, Aspect Oriented Programming, AspectJ Design Patterns, BDD, TDD, Mockito
</p>

    A graduate of Computer Science (MEng) at the University of Warwick, I have taken a keen interest in machine learning and artificial intelligence. See my GitHub profile for some of the work that I completed as part of my studies.
