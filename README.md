These files are used to generate my personal home page, robin.pm. As you can see, it's pretty basic at the moment and definitely under construction... that will hopefully change soon when I have a bit more free time. 

If you spot any factual errors or spelling mistakes, please do feel free to raise an issue or PR and I will do my best to get it corrected. 

TODO: 
- Sort out the layout - the default template looks great but a little too generic
- Flesh out the content 
- Make this into a proper markdown file...
